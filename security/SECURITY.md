# 🛡️ Quantum-NFL Security Guidelines

## Core Principles
1. 🎯 Zero-Trust Architecture
2. 🔐 Principle of Least Privilege
3. 🎵 Quantum State Protection

## Security Measures
### Data Protection
- All quantum states must be encrypted at rest
- Use quantum-resistant encryption for sensitive data
- Regular backups with versioning

### Access Control
- Multi-factor authentication required
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Regular access audits

### Code Security
- All code must pass security scanning
- Dependencies must be verified
- No sensitive data in code or comments

### Monitoring
- Real-time quantum state monitoring
- Intrusion detection systems
- Regular security audits

## 🍺 Remember
Security is like a good beer - it should be:
- Well-crafted
- Consistently maintained
- Enjoyed responsibly
