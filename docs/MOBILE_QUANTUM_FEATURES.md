## Technical Implementation Notes

### 1. Performance Optimization
```javascript
// Use RequestAnimationFrame with throttling
const throttledUpdate = throttle(() => {
    requestAnimationFrame(updateQuantumEffects);
}, 16); // ~60fps
```

### 2. Battery Consideration
```javascript
// Check battery status
navigator.getBattery().then(battery => {
    const powerMode = battery.charging ? 'high' : 'low';
    adjustQuantumEffects(powerMode);
});
```

### 3. Offline Support
```javascript
// Service Worker for offline quantum calculations
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/quantum-worker.js');
}
```

## Physical World Integration Examples

### 1. Stadium Detection
```javascript
function checkStadiumProximity(position) {
    const stadiums = {
        'AT&T Stadium': { lat: 32.7473, lng: -97.0945 },
        'Lambeau Field': { lat: 44.5013, lng: -88.0622 }
    };
    // Enhance quantum effects near stadiums
}
```

### 2. Motion Detection
```javascript
function detectThrowingMotion(acceleration) {
    const threshold = {
        x: 15, // m/sÂ²
        y: 10,
        z: 12
    };
    // Trigger quantum effects based on throwing motion
}
```

### 3. Environmental Adaptation
```javascript
function adjustToEnvironment() {
    // Time of day effects
    const hour = new Date().getHours();
    // Weather API integration
    // Stadium crowd noise level
}
```
