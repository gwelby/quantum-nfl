# NFL Quantum Teams Algorithms

## Quantum Concepts Applied to NFL Analysis

### 1. Historical Echo Resonance
The historical echo algorithm uses quantum superposition to analyze past game outcomes:
```python
resonance = base_power * history_factor * quantum_interference
```

### 2. Playoff Amplification
Amplifies team performance metrics in playoff scenarios using quantum tunneling:
```python
playoff_power = regular_season_power * (1 + playoff_experience * pressure_factor)
```

### 3. Rivalry Resonance
Models team rivalries using quantum entanglement principles:
```python
rivalry_strength = (intensity + history + fan_energy + field_clash) / 4
```

### 4. Team Quantum Fields
Each team generates a quantum field that influences game outcomes:
```python
field_strength = home_advantage * weather_adaptation * fan_energy
```

### 5. Quantum Interference
Team interactions are modeled using quantum interference patterns:
```python
interference = team1_wave.conjugate() * team2_wave
```
