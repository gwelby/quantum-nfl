# NFL Team Analysis Methodology

## Overview
The NFL Quantum Teams system uses advanced quantum computing concepts to analyze team performance and predict outcomes.

## Key Metrics

### 1. Team Quantum State
- Offense Rating (0-1)
- Defense Rating (0-1)
- Special Teams Rating (0-1)
- Coaching Factor (0-1)
- Home Field Advantage (0-1)

### 2. Historical Performance
- Win-Loss Record
- Point Differential
- Strength of Schedule
- Historical Rivalries
- Playoff Experience

### 3. Current Season Metrics
- Current Form
- Injury Impact
- Weather Adaptation
- Fan Energy
- Momentum

## Analysis Methods

### 1. Historical Echo Analysis
```
Historical Echo = Î£(Past Games * Decay Factor * Importance)
```

### 2. Rivalry Resonance
```
Rivalry Power = (Intensity + History + Fan Energy + Field Clash) / 4
```

### 3. Playoff Amplification
```
Playoff Power = Regular Season Power * (1 + Playoff Experience * Pressure)
```

### 4. Team Combinations
```
Combined Power = Base Power * Synergy * Special Effects
```
