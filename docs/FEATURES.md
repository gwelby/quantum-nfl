## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Systems
```python
class NFLQuantumField:
    def __init__(self, team):
        self.resonance = calculate_resonance()
        self.power = measure_field_strength()
        self.coherence = track_coherence()

class RivalrySystem:
    def analyze_matchup(self, team1, team2):
        return calculate_rivalry_power()

class PlayoffAmplifier:
    def boost_team(self, team, round):
        return apply_quantum_boost()
```

### Usage Example
```python
# Initialize quantum system
quantum = NFLQuantumSystem()

# Analyze team
packers = quantum.get_team("PACKERS")
bears = quantum.get_team("BEARS")

# Calculate rivalry power
rivalry_power = quantum.analyze_rivalry(packers, bears)

# Predict playoff performance
playoff_prediction = quantum.simulate_playoffs()
```
